How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    - I don't have to scroll all through a file.
	- Typos are found much more easily since I only have to check part of the file
	- Missing code is easily identified
	- Not as much code "clutter" around the bug -> easier to find

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    - Faster debugging
	- Better understanding of how bugs occur and why
	- Easy to use previous discarded versions of code that turn out to having been better

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    PRO
	- Not having a huge number of versions saved that don't really have differences and thus are hard to find the point where a certain change was made
	CON
	- Forgetting to save timely might take you beyond a smart recovery point and thus forcing you to redo a lot of your work

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    - Because Git is for mulit-file environments
	- Because Git manages environments with connected files, Google Docs are independet files

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    - Didn't use git log and diff... ?

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    - You can always recover old versions
    - The process to do that is quick

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    - Versioning software / website versions

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

	- Reuse old pieces of code, understand development of code

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

   - Fast way to recover and find when changes are made
   - Don't have to rewrite entire code but can correct pieces -> bigger changes are possible
