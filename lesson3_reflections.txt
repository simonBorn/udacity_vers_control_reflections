When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  - Working on a repository with more than one person
  - Working on a repository from more than one location (ie. different work locations or work / home)
  - Also helps preventing local cpu crashes / data loss

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  - You only want to post changes publically that passed your own "quality assesment" and that you do want to share with others

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

 - Clones are duplications of entire repositories.
 - When cloning a GitHub repository into another GitHub account, the process is called forking
 - Forking brings with it some further advantages of reference to the originally forked repository (credits, easy way to suggest changes to original repository)
 - Branches are feature branches of one repository. They should not be used for entirely new projects but only for features of one project.
